# Windsurf Development Rules

## Kotlin Style
- Use data-oriented design: prefer data classes, value classes, and ADTs.
- All entity and model properties must be `val` unless mutable state is required for JPA/Hibernate integration.
- Use sealed classes for modeling domain hierarchies and events.
- Avoid mutable properties and collections within models and domain classes.

## Panache ORM Integration
- Extend PanacheEntity or PanacheEntityBase for database entities. Place query logic in companion objects or repositories.
- Favor constructor initialization of entity properties; minimize use of setters.
- All database models should be immutable unless unavoidable.

## Testing
- Every feature and data transformation must have unit tests.
- Repository and entity logic must have isolated integration tests with Postgres.
- Use mocks/stubs for any external/database dependencies in unit tests.

## Templates
- Use Qute for SSR templates; avoid stateful/render logic in templates.

## General Practices
- Adhere to idiomatic Kotlin design and minimize boilerplate.
- Document any mutable state rationale in code comments.
