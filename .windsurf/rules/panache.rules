- Extend PanacheEntity or PanacheEntityBase for database entities. Place query logic in companion objects or repositories.
- Favor constructor initialization of entity properties; minimize use of setters.
- To preserve domain model immutability, create a separate, mutable entity class for persistence (e.g., 
`ProductEntity`). Use a dedicated mapper to convert between the pure domain model and the persistence entity.
