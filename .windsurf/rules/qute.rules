- Use Qute for SSR templates; avoid stateful/render logic in templates.
- Write Qute in templates files instead of in resources or controllers.
- Use Qute's data binding to pass data to templates.
- For Kotlin value classes, use Template Extension Methods to expose their properties to the template.
- Organize Qute templates into subdirectories that mirror the feature-based package structure. For example, templates related to the com.sthompson.product feature should be placed in src/main/resources/templates/products/.
- Extract CSS from Qute templates into separate .css files located in src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/css/. Avoid large inline <style> blocks to improve maintainability and enable browser caching.
