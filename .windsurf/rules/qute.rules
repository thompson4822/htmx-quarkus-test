- Use Qute for SSR templates; avoid stateful/render logic in templates.
- Write Qute in templates files instead of in resources or controllers.
- Use Qute's data binding to pass data to templates.
- For Kotlin value classes, use Template Extension Methods to expose their properties to the template.
- Extract CSS from Qute templates into separate .css files located in src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/css/. Avoid large inline <style> blocks to improve maintainability and enable browser caching.
- All HTML-producing files, whether static or dynamic, will be treated as Qute templates and located within src/main/resources/templates. Templates must be grouped by feature into subdirectories that mirror the package structure (e.g., templates for com.sthompson.product go in templates/products/).
- Always use JAX-RS endpoints (e.g., @Path(\"/products\")) to serve web pages. Avoid exposing file extensions like .html in user-facing URLs. The endpoint is responsible for rendering the appropriate Qute template.
- Qute fragments (partials) must be clearly distinguished from full-page templates. Fragments must:
    - Include .qute in their filename (e.g., _my-fragment.qute.html).
    - Never be a complete HTML document; they must not contain <html> or <body> tags.
    - Be prefixed with an underscore (_) to signify they are partials not meant to be rendered directly.
